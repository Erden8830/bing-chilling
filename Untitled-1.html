    <h1>How to Get Bing Chilling</h1>
    <p>
        Bing chilling is this meme that came from a video of John Cena eating ice cream and speaking Chinese. 
        Bing chilling (冰淇凌, the correct spelling in Chinese is bing qilin but it sounds like bing chilling so foreigners spell it that way)
         means ice cream and of course he says it a lot in the video
